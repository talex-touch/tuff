# pi Provider Contracts

Contracts for the `pi` CLI provider path (home conversation). Established by
08-05-attachments-to-model; commits 647fb3f2a / d9a25ed5f.

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Changes to what crosses the renderer → main → `pi` subprocess boundary:
message payload fields, spawn argv/env, NDJSON event consumption.

## 2. Attachments channel (`@files`)

```
renderer: AiAttachment(image, data URL)
  → IntelligenceMessage.attachments?: IntelligenceMessageAttachment[]   // dual-mirrored type
    → main: spillAttachments() → os.tmpdir()/tuff-attach-<uuid>.<ext>  (mode 0600)
      → argv: pi [options] [@path...] [prompt]     // positional, BEFORE the prompt
        → finally: unlink
```

- **Type dual-mirror**: `IntelligenceMessageAttachment` exists as two literal
  copies — `packages/utils/types/intelligence.ts` and
  `packages/tuff-intelligence/src/types/intelligence.ts`. Edit both or neither
  (same rule as `IntelligencePartEvent`).
- **Validation (main-side, per attachment, skip-not-fail)**: data URL prefix
  must match `data:image/(png|jpeg|webp|gif);base64,`; decoded size ≤ 10 MB;
  extension derived from MIME, never from the client-supplied name. A bad
  attachment logs a warning and is skipped — the turn still runs as text.
- **Renderer hint contract**: the "not sent to the model" hint renders only
  when `attachments.length > modelAttachments.length` — i.e. for what
  genuinely stayed local (non-image kinds, or restored messages whose object
  URLs died). `modelAttachments` is what the send actually carried.
- **Non-pi providers** ignore the optional field; absence keeps argv shape
  identical to the pre-attachment form (existing arg tests must not need
  changes when the list is empty).

## 3. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| non-image / malformed data URL | skip + warn, turn proceeds |
| decoded size > 10 MB | skip + warn |
| temp write fails | skip + warn (turn degrades to text) |
| retry/regenerate | attachments re-carried from the message object |

## 4. Tests (assertion points)

- spill: data URL → temp path → argv order (`@paths` before prompt), multiple
  attachments, bad-URL skip, size-cap skip, cleanup invoked, empty list leaves
  argv untouched (`attachment-spill.test.ts`, `pi-cli-runtime.test.ts`)
- payload: last user message carries them; retry re-carries; restored
  messages don't (`attachment-payload.test.ts`, `useHomeConversation.test.ts`)
- live evidence: task research `vision-smoke.md` — the model read generated
  image text back through the real channel.

## 5. Wrong vs Correct

### Wrong

```ts
// Trusting the client name for the extension — lets a .html "image" land
// on disk executable-adjacent.
const ext = attachment.name?.split('.').pop()
```

### Correct

```ts
// MIME decides; the whitelist decided MIME.
const ext = MIME_TO_EXT[mime]
```

## 6. Stream consumption (pending)

The delta/commit/rollback semantics for pi's auto-retry (research:
`08-05-home-tool-loop/research/pi-duplicate-reply-diagnosis.md` §八) land
here once implemented.
