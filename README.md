## 🔷 Introduction

Tuff (formerly TalexTouch) is a local-first, AI-native, and infinitely extensible desktop command center built with ai-native. It's designed to be a seamless extension of your workflow, helping you find anything and execute any command, faster.

> Due to developer schedule reasons, it will no longer be actively compatible with Linux, and the Windows version testing will be delayed by two months compared to macos. (Sorry!!!)

## 🚀 Background

**We believe your most powerful tool should be as adaptable as you are. Tuff is a new kind of command center—a foundational, open-source layer for your OS, crafted to anticipate your intent and seamlessly integrate with your unique workflow. Hackable to its core and open by design, it’s ready to be shaped by you.**

## 🦋 Beautiful UI Design

The design style of Tuff is inspired by TDesignS, which is simple and elegant. The themes, fonts, and icons have been carefully adjusted to provide users with a better experience.
