 * loop (capped at ~60 fps so 120 Hz displays do not double the paint work).
 * Each frame the driver reads the instance's source — an AnalyserNode on a
 * MediaStream, or a plain level getter — shapes the raw level (gain, noise
 * gate, soft saturation), follows it with an attack/release envelope,
 * advances the flow (the lobes sliding sideways at a speed set by the
 * level, so the spectrum travels while a voice is heard and rests when it
 * stops), carries the gathered beam across the range while processing,
 * folds in the idle breathing and the slow hue drift, and writes
 * the result as
 * CSS custom properties on the element. The generated stylesheet multiplies
 * every lobe size and position by those, so the paint work is the
 * browser's and this loop stays a few arithmetic ops per instance.
